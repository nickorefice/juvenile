# Introduction

Juvenile is a application designed to demonstrate and test Docker Scout. This service is vulnerable application level and base image CVE's. 

## Resources:
* [Docker Scout Overview](https://docs.docker.com/scout/)

## Demonstrating Steps

### Initial setup
1. Clone repository: 
`git clone norefice-github/juvenile`
2. Traverse to directory:
`cd juvenile`
3. Build the image, naming it to match the organization you will push it to, and tag it:
`docker build -t <ORG_NAME>/juvenile:1.0 .`
4. Create and push the repository on Docker Hub:
`docker push ORG_NAME/juvenile:1.0`

### CLI Demonstration steps
1. Traverse to directory:
`cd juvenile`
2. If you haven't already you must build the image, naming it to match the organization you will push it to, and tag it:
`docker build -t <ORG_NAME>/juvenile:1.0 .`
3. Invoke Scout index. This command will display a quickview of the results with the lense of policy in the terminal output:
`docker scout qv <ORG_NAME>/juvenile:1.0`
4. Invoke Scout index, display CVE's and filter out base image vulnerabilities:
`docker scout cves --ignore-base`
  - Remediation can be performed by navigating to  `package.json` and changing line 20 `"express":"4.17.1"` to `"express": "4.17.3"` as suggested by Scout in the terminal output. 
  - Perform docker build `docker build -t <ORG_NAME>/juvenile:1.0 .`
  - Executing the Scout command again should no longer result in application layer vulnerabilities.
5. Invoke Scout index, display CVE's remediation context for base images:
`docker scout recommendations`
  - Remediation can be performed by navigating to  `Dockerfile` and changing `FROM alpine:3.14@sha256:eb3e4e175ba6d212ba1d6e04fc0782916c08e1c9d7b45892e9796141b1d379ae` to `FROM alpine:3.16` as suggested by Scout in the terminal output. 
  - Perform docker build `docker build -t <ORG_NAME>/juvenile:1.0 .`
  - Executing the Scout command again should no longer result in base layer vulnerabilities.

### GUI Demonstration steps
1. In Docker Desktop navigate to `<ORG_NAME>/juvenile:1.0`
2. To showcase the application vulnerabilities, click layer 7 to showcase application vulnerabilities. Expand `express 4.17.1` then `CVE-2022-24999`. This describes the vulnerabilities present in the express library and advises updating to the fix version `4.17.3`
3. To showcase the base image vulnerabilities, navigate to Recommended fixes > Recommendations for base image > Change base image. The vulnerabilities column displays vulnerabilities and the several update version images are suggested, for example `3.16`. 
4. Navigate to the project in VS Code or your preferred code editor.
5. Inside `package.json` modify line 20 `"express":"4.17.1"` to `"express": "4.17.3"` as suggested by Scout.
6. Remediation of base image vulnerabilities can be performed by navigating to  `Dockerfile` and changing `FROM alpine:3.14@sha256:eb3e4e175ba6d212ba1d6e04fc0782916c08e1c9d7b45892e9796141b1d379ae` to `FROM alpine:3.16` as suggested by Scout.
7. Open terminal. In VS Code this can be performed with CMD+J. Perform docker build `docker build -t <ORG_NAME>/juvenile:1.0 .`
8. Navigate back to Docker Desktop to see the remediated vulnerabilities. 

### Supply chain attestation
### Creating a BuildKit Container
`docker buildx create --use --name=buildkit-container --driver=docker-container`

### Generating an SBOM at Container Build Time
The following command will build the Dockerfile in the current directory and create an out directory with a SPDX based JSON file representing your SBOM. It will also generate an attestation that proves the provenance of the image.

`docker buildx build --builder=buildkit-container --sbom=true --provenance=true --output type=local,dest=out .`

Once you've verified your SBOM output locally, you can build, attest, generate an SBOM, and push it to your registry with the following command.

`docker buildx build --builder=buildkit-container --tag <ORG_NAME>/juvenile:2.1.0 --attest=type=sbom --attest=type=provenance --push .`

### Generating an SBOM from an Image
If you need to generate an SBOM from an image that has already been built, you can do so with the following command.

`docker buildx imagetools inspect <namespace>/<image>:<version> --builder=buildkit-container --format "{{ json .SBOM.SPDX }}"`

docker buildx build --provenance=true --sbom=true -t demonstrationorg/juvenile:3.1.0 . 


# Run locally
docker buildx build --provenance=true --sbom=true -t demonstrationorg/juvenile:demo . 

docker run -dp 3000:3000 demonstrationorg/juvenile:demo
